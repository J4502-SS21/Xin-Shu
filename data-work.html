<h1>Food Delivery Database Applications</h1>
<p>I designed a food delivery database through MySQL with functions including processing massive real-time orders,
supporting diverse stores, and allowing users to store multiple addresses and payment methods, obtaining scores of
merchants and drivers, merchants’ contacts and other information to ensure a good user experience.
<br><br>I constructed entity-relationship model, two-dimensional table of the relational data model and data dictionary, and
established a database to realize functions of account registering, adding new addresses, canceling the transaction,updating orders, obtaining driver’s license plate number, etc.
<br><br>I composed 10,000+ pieces of dummy data for database function test, and designed the web user interface.</p>
<h1>Racial Disparities in Policing Data Analysis</h1>
<p>I collected 90,000+ pieces of data about police vehicle stops in Columbia, Missouri and fatal police shootings nationwide
from 2014 to 2019, and cleaned the data by checking data consistency, correcting errors, and processing null values in
OpenRefine.
<br><br>I visualized data in maps and line charts through Tableau to show regional and temporal variations in racial
discrimination in police enforcement.
<br><br>I concluded that racial disparity was widespread in policing and the probability of occurrence increased from 2014 to
2019; provided in-depth reporting with data support such as that black people are four times more likely to be shot dead
by the police than white people in Missouri and the Columbia Police Department officers are more likely to stop a black
driver than a white driver.
</p>
<h1>A/B Test for E-commerce Website Operation</h1>
<p>
I analyzed 300,000+ pieces of data with variables such as user ID, page type, timestamp, and conversion (0-no, 1-yes).
<br><br>I conducted A/B tests based on Python (Pandas, Numpy) to derive the z-score and p-value, and fit the logistic regression
model by StatsModels.
<br><br>I concluded that countries, pages, and their interactions had little impact on user conversion rates, and thus recommended
the e-commerce company to extend the testing time for further observation and stop publishing new website pages.</p>
